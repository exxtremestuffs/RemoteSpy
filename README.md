# RemoteSpy
Tool used to log calls of Roblox network objects; requires a conventional script execution exploit.

This is a quicc patch to the Hydroxide Remote Spy (it doesn't support args, not much I can do about that)

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**
Step 1: Download the github project as a ZIP file (https://i.imgur.com/28IMSZp.png)

Step 2: Move the folder inside the ZIP file (don't change the name) to your exploit's workspace directory (https://i.imgur.com/0pY2pqY.png)
